Schema acceptance criteria:

- Recommendation is exactly `ship`, `hold`, or `hold-with-waiver`.
- Requirement Coverage has one row per active `R` and `RI`.
- `ship` is used only when required gates have evidence and no active unwaived blocker remains.
- `hold` includes blocker IDs, owner, risk, and exact next action.
- `hold-with-waiver` includes explicit user acceptance of risk, owner, and follow-up.
- PR/CI/release/deployment/source status is explicit when configured, or marked not applicable.
- Rollback names trigger, action, and owner.
- No external action is claimed without evidence.
- Next Phase is Reflect only for `ship` or accepted `hold-with-waiver`.
