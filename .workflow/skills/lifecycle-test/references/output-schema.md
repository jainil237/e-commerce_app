Schema acceptance criteria:

- `manifest_ids` includes every active `R` and `RI` verified, failed, skipped, or waived.
- Automated Checks lists every command run or intentionally not run.
- Manifest Coverage has one row per active `R` and `RI`.
- Manual QA states `not applicable` when unused.
- Generated Output Evidence states `not applicable` when unused.
- Skipped Checks names reason, risk, owner, and Ship impact.
- Findings says `none` when no findings exist.
- Sign-Off includes verifier, date, and recommendation.
- Recommendation is exactly `ship`, `hold`, or `hold-with-waiver`.
