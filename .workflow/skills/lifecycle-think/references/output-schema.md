Requirement Manifest sub-section requirements:

- **Explicit (R)**: every `R` ID must have at least one `Acceptance:` criterion.
- **Implicit (RI)**: every `RI` ID must have at least one `Acceptance:` criterion.
- **Assumptions (A)**: present even when empty; must not contain user-authority decisions — those belong as `Q` IDs.
- **Open Questions (Q)**: every `Q` ID must include `Owner:` and `Blocking: yes / no`; blocking `Q` IDs must mirror in `orchestration.blockers`.
